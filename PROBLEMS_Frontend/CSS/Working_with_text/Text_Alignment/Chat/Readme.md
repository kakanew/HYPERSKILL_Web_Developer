## Chat

You are training, and now your goal is to create a small chat. Almost done, but the chat doesn't look like what you want. Your messages and the messages of the interlocutor are aligned to the left. It is very inconvenient to read this way and it is completely impossible to understand which message was sent to you and which one you sent.

You need to write a property and value to help separate your messages, as is usually done in chats. (the class of your messages is `.white`. Please do not use the end value to solve this problem).
