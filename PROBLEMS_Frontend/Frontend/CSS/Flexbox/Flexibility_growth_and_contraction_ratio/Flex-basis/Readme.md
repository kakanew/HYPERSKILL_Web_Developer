## Flex-basis

This is a web site navigation bar. Right now a user is browsing the catalog.

You need to set the initial width value of all the menu items to 1vw and make the current section bigger than the others by giving it 2/5 of the free space. The result should be identical to the picture below:

Hint

Default value for flex-grow is **0**, so don't forget to apply the property to `.menu-item`.
