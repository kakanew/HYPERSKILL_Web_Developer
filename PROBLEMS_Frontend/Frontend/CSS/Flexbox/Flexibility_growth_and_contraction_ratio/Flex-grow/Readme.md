## Flex-grow

Make each section bigger than the previous one by giving it a bigger part of the remaining free space. Use the `flex-grow` property and make the sum of the values equal to **10**.

Hint

> The `flex-grow` property value of the first section plus the `flex-grow` value of the second section plus ... = 10
