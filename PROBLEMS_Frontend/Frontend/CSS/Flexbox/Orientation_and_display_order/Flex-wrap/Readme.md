## Flex-wrap

Add just enough product cards to make them go beyond the borders of the container. Then make them move to the next line.

Keep the classnames consistent. The next item, for example, should have the `class="product product3"` attribute.

You may copy the code sample below:

```html
<div class="product product1">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/GVwHH3C/placeholder.jpg">
  <p class="name">Name of the product 1</p>
  <p>Ordered 124 times</p>
  <p><strong>Price: 100$</strong></p>
</div>
```
