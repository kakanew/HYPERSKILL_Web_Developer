        <p><b>Augusta Lovelace</b> was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles
            Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
            recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm
            intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to
            recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.</p>
