## event.key

What do you need to write in parentheses to get the event handler that works after pressing *V* only?

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
  if (...) {
    return event;
  }
});
```

Write *only* the missing part.

Hint

> Note that the symbol *V* is a capital letter and the property `event.code` cannot work with capital letters only.
