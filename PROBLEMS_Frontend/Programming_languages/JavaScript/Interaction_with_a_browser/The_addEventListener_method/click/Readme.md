## keydown

Write the missing part of the code so that the `click` event handler appears. Apply the method to register the event handler to the tag with id `navBar` with help `getElementById()` method.

```javascript
document.???, function() {
  return "The click event has occurred";
});
```

There's **no** need to rewrite the whole code. In the answer box, enter the missing part of code.
