## keydown

Write the missing part of the code so that the `keydown` event handler appears. Apply the method to register the event handler to the `document` object.

```javascript
???, function() {
  return "The keydown event has occurred";
});
```

There's **no** need to rewrite the whole code. In the answer box, enter the missing part of code.
