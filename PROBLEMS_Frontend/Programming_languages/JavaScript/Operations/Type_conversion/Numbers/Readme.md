## Numbers

Select the values that can become *numbers* after an implicit numerical conversion attempt.

Hint

Remember how the `+` works with many operands if one of them is a string. You can check your answer using the `typeof` operator.

> Also, remember that binary plus *cannot* turn a string into a number, while the `Number()` function can. So the result of the expression `"5" + 7` will be a string, and the result `Number("5" + 7)` will be a number.
