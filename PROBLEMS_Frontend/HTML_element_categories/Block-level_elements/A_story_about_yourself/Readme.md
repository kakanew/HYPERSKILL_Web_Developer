## A story about yourself

Let's get acquainted! Tell us a little about yourself by creating an HTML file. Write the HTML markup. Write what you like and put this text in the `<p>` tag. Don't forget to make a title for your story and put it in `<h1>`. [Find a tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements#Elements) to wrap **a long quote** in. Add your favorite quote to your story about yourself.

If you do not want to use your data, you can use random text.
