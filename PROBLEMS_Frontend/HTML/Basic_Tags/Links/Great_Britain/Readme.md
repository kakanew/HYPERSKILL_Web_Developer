## Great Britain

Write a page that contains three paragraphs `<p>` (all without quotes):

1. id = “main-information”, text — “Main information”;
2. id = “history”, text — “History”;
3. id = “tours”, text — “Tours”;

Add a navigation block to the page using `<nav>`. The navigation should contain three links (one per paragraph), each with the same text as in a paragraph. All the links should have `title` attributes that match their text. The title of the page should be `Great Britain`.
