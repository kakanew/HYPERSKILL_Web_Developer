##### About

One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is binding the functionality of a web application to the keys on the keyboard. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills of working with keyboard keys, we will make a virtual piano in this project.

##### Learning outcomes

You will learn how to write HTML documents and work with the most popular CSS properties. You will also learn how to use *JavaScript* to make event handlers for browser events and create and insert new elements into documents.
