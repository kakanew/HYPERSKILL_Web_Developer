# Project: Virtual Piano

## Stage 4/5: Let there be music

### Description

The keys look cool, but they do not fully qualify as a musical instrument just yet. Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix.

Change the event handler so that when you press the `A` key, an audio object is created and played. You can use [the audio recordings](https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/315625/white_keys.zip) we offer or specify your own. Check the result in a browser. Your piano should hopefully make its first sound!

> If you have problems playing audio recordings, try to specify the path to them relative to the HTML file.

Perform this operation for the remaining six keys, and the stage will be considered complete.

### Objectives

Modify the event handlers so that when you press the assigned keys, audio objects are created and played instead of messages displayed in the console.
