<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The keys look cool, but they do not fully qualify as a musical instrument just yet. Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix.</p>

<p>Change the event handler so that when you press the <code class="java">A</code> key, an audio object is created and played. You can use <a target="_blank" href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/315625/white_keys.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the audio recordings</a> we offer or specify your own. Check the result in a browser. Your piano should hopefully make its first sound!</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">If you have problems playing audio recordings, try to specify the path to them relative to the HTML file.</div></p>

<p>Perform this operation for the remaining six keys, and the stage will be considered complete.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Modify the event handlers so that when you press the assigned keys, audio objects are created and played instead of messages displayed in the console.</p>
