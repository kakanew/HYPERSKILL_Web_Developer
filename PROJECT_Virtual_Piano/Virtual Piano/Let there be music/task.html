<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Having keys that do not produce sound is certainly good, but it does not fully reflect the concept of musical instruments. Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix.</p>

<p>Declare a function that will be responsible for the sound produced by key <code>A</code>. Inside the function, create an audio object with the path to the desired <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/315625/white_keys.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">audio recording</a>. Add to it a method that will start playing the sound.</p>

<p>Now change the event handler so that when you press the <code>A</code> key, the function you created will be called instead of just outputting text to the console. Check the result in a browser. Your piano has hopefully made its first sound!</p>

<p>Perform this operation for the remaining six keys, and the stage will be considered complete.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Declare 7 functions, in each of which create an audio object and start its playback.</li>
	<li>Change the event handlers so that instead of displaying messages in the console, when the previously specified keys are pressed, the created functions are called.</li>
</ol>
