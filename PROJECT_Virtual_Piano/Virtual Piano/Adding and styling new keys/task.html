<h2>Description</h2>

<p>If you have a feeling that something is still missing, you're right: a piano has more than just the white keys. Create five more black keys using the <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> paired tag and bind them to the <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/315625/black_keys.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">corresponding sounds</a>.</p>

<p>Use letters <code>W</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>U</code> for the black keys; position them as they normally look on a real musical instrument.</p>

<p>For this to succeed, you need to slightly change the code you've already written and add new styles, taking into account the following points:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You already have the styles applied to the keys. To prevent conflict of existing and written properties in the future, wrap <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> responsible for white keys in the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag with the <code>white-keys</code> class. Then you open the CSS file, fix the <code>kbd</code> selector to <code>.white-keys kbd</code>. Such a record means that it does not refer to tags, but only to tags that have the appropriate class. Check that the application didn't crash after editing the code and still displays the same view.</li>
	<li>Wrap your new five keys in <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> too, but with the class <code>black-keys</code>. </li>
	<li>New keys should be black. Do this by applying properties to the <code>.black-keys kbd</code> selector.</li>
	<li>Place the black keys on top of the white keys and resize the black keys, remembering to set the <code>display</code> property to <code>inline-block</code> value.</li>
	<li>Сhange the color of the letters that are responsible for your new keys. You can also change the font, size and formatting styles of the text if you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>[ALERT-primary]Use the <code>id</code> attribute  for the keys to which you want to set unique styles. For example, the location styles.[/ALERT]</p>

<p>Congratulations, now you have a new project for your portfolio! <br>
	<br>
	The project is over, yet your ambitions ask for more? After passing this stage, you can continue to develop and improve the project yourself. If you wish, you can represent the corpus piano, add animation when pressing keys, increase the number of keys or alter the sounds emitted, because right now you only have one octave. Good luck!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Create 5 <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> tags in an HTML file that will be responsible for the black keys:  <code>W</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>U</code>.</li>
	<li>Create event handlers that play audio when keys with these characters are pressed.</li>
	<li>Wrap white keys in tag <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with class <code>white-keys</code>.</li>
	<li>Wrap black keys in tag <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with class <code>black-keys</code>.</li>
	<li>Set the black background color to the keys you created at this stage.</li>
	<li>Resize the black keys.</li>
	<li>Change the location of the black keys.</li>
	<li>Change the color of the characters displayed on the black keys.</li>
</ol>
