# Project: Virtual Piano

## Stage 1/5: Add markup

### Description

Some things are really more convenient to do with the keyboard than with the mouse. Besides, it is very important to make your product available to a variety of users, including those with physical disabilities like poor eyesight and/or impaired fine motor skills. For a virtual piano, the keyboard is, of course, an indispensable thing.

To proceed with the project, please install *node.js* on your device. You can download it from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). This program will allow us to check your work on the project.

To go through the first step, change the HTML page title and then assign the keys for your virtual piano.

The `<kbd>` tag is used to denote the keyboard input or a key name (you can read more about it [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd)). Use this paired tag in the body of the document to specify seven keys on the keyboard: `A`, `S`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, and `J`. These will be the white keys on the piano.

If you open this HTML file in your browser, you'll see the names of the keyboard keys. These keys do not make sounds yet, but you're one step closer to creating a working virtual piano.

### Objectives

1. Change the page title to "Virtual Piano".
2. Add 7 `<kbd>` tags to the document body and enclose letters `A`, `S`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, and `J` in them.

### Example

*In the browser, the result of this step will look like this:*
