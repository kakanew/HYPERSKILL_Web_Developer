# Project: Virtual Piano

## Stage 3/5: Application functionality

### Description

As good developers, we want our applications to be pretty, which extends to functionality, too. What good is a pretty picture that doesn't do much? To go through this stage, you will have to create a JavaScript file with event handlers that will be triggered when you press one of the seven keys assigned to your piano keyboard. Let the console print an individual message for each key. Your message should contain the key name enclosed in single quotes. For instance:

```css
The 'A' key is pressed.
```

If some unbound key was pressed, a warning text should appear in the console.

Check the result: the application should look the same, but now, eight different messages should appear in the console when you press the assigned keys.

### Objectives

1. Create event handlers that will output messages in the console when you press the previously assigned keys. Your message should contain the name of the key in single quotes.
2. If any other key is pressed, output a warning in the console.
